# Basic Text-based Chatbot

This project implements a simple text-based chatbot capable of having basic conversations with users. The chatbot uses the `nltk` library and utilizes pre-defined patterns to match user inputs and respond accordingly. It was developed as part of my internship work at @CodeAlpha.

## Features

- **Basic Conversations**: The chatbot can respond to a variety of user inputs such as greetings, simple questions, and casual conversations.
- **Customizable**: The bot's responses and patterns can be easily customized by adding or modifying the predefined patterns.
- **Natural Language Processing**: The chatbot uses the `nltk` library for natural language processing to understand and respond to user input.
- **Simple Interaction**: Users can have a text-based conversation with the chatbot, which will respond with predefined answers or clarify when it doesn't understand.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The chatbot is developed using Python, which is easy to integrate with various libraries and APIs.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: This Python library is used to implement the logic for natural language processing, pattern matching, and text manipulation.
